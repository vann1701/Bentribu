# Bentribu
The engine used in this project is unity. Other programs used to make this project is sketchup and vuforia
Minimal coding was required to make this project.
Most of the things that were done in this project is through the unity engine itself
Vuforia was used as the database and the container of the images.
Sketchup is used to make the 3d models that were projected in the project.
Most of the codes used is mostly for initializing the scenes (see attached photo "scenes")
Thank you po
